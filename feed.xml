                <p>A blog (or weblog) is an online personal journal that is frequently updated and used for the general public. The blog is determined by their format: a wide range of items are taken on a single page in order. Blogs back in time often represent the personality of the author or reflect the purpose of the web site that hosts the blog. Topics sometimes include brief philosophical musings, commentary on the Internet and other social issues, and links to other sites the author favors, especially those who support a point being made on a post.</p>
<p>Below are the list of blogs written in PHP which can be used with any kind of paid or free web hosts.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">With the increase in craze for online shopping and wider accessibility to internet, lots of online store has been started in Nepal with motive to provide home shopping with just few clicks. There are still lots of advantages and disadvantages of online shopping but with the establishment of big stores and its demand for shopping has made these site more user-friendly and trusted. To point out its advantages, one can buy it just staying in home and comparing the huge variety of items with price, which make the buyer more easier and confident. But some of the disadvantages are that the product might not be what that appears on their screen, shipping limited to few of the places, online payment instead of cash on delivery and hectic replacement procedure. In this post, I am going to list out the online shopping sites that are working actively in Nepali market. If you like this post please share and comment.</p>
